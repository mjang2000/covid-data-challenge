"Notes"
"For purposes of this table, states were included if they required insurers to take the listed actions. A number of states released guidance or recommendations for insurers to take the actions listed in this table but fell short of issuing a requirement and are thus not included."
""
"* The Families First Coronavirus Response Act requires all group health plans and individual health insurance policies to cover testing and associated visits related to the diagnosis of COVID-19 with no cost sharing and prohibits them from imposing prior authorization requirements on these services during the federally declared emergency period. Federal law supersedes any state requirements."
""
"See [here](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/paid-family-and-sick-leave/) for more detailed information on paid sick leave policies."


Footnotes
"1. Both DC and NM are requiring insurers to waive cost-sharing for treatment of non-COVID respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia and influenza."
"2. DC's special enrollment period was not adopted in response to coronavirus, but is open to a broad group of people, including those who are uninsured."
"3. OK requires a premium nonpayment grace period extension for all health insurance policies and prohibits insurers from canceling coverage for anyone diagnosed with COVID-19 and unable to return to work or maintain coverage due to COVID-19."
